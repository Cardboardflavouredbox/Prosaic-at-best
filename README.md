# Prosaic at best

Prosaic at best is a fighting game built entirely from the ground up using C++ and SFML.
So far it has only one person working on it, that being, big suprise, me.
Since all the visuals, audio, and coding is all done by one person, don't expect that much yet.

## Movelist
(direction-numpad keys,light-A,medium-B,heavy-C,special-S)


### Test guy the test character (wow)
Test guy's gimmick is feinting. The special variation of all his moves are feint moves.

**236+normal:some sort of clap attack**
Weak version doesn't do much.
Medium version does a hard knockdown.
Heavy version launches.

**623+normal:crappy dragon punch**
Doesn't really function as an anti-air that much.
It's just pretty crappy.

**214+normal:fireball thingy**
Heavier versions are faster.

**214+two normals: super fireball thingy**
Far faster than the normal ones. Costs one bar.

**special while being hit: Combo breaker.**
A lil uppercut that sucks. At least it gives you some invincibility.


### Arthur J. Sinclair the random radio producer guy
Sinclair's gimmick is accelerating and slowing down time. He's probably a setup character??
He also needs a lot of meter to do combos so remember that.

**235+normal:coin toss**
Projectile that is initially slow, but becomes fast after being triggered.
Weak versions can be triggered by using the special key.
Medium versions don't exist yet lol.
Heavy versions get triggered automatically after some time.

**214+normal:shoulder bash**
Goes further the heavier it is, and the heavy version does two hits.
The special version teleports in front of the opponent and does a wallbounce, but has long startup.

**623+normal:time grab thing**
Command grab that slows down opponent.
Special version is a hitgrab that knocks down, but the time slowdown is so short that you can't combo after it.

**2+special: time acceleration**
Everything else slows down. Combo extender.
Opponents can still block, so don't use it raw.
Requires 0.5 bar.
Drains meter gradually, can be ended early by using it again.

**235+two normals: counter super**
A counter that slows down the opponent.
doesn't have much of note as of now.
Costs one bar.
